#Welcome to NeuroBlue!

##What is NeuroBlue?
NeuroBlue is a project to develop a convenient system for neuroprosthetics to be retrained throughout the day.
This repo is specifically for the bluetooth communication aspect of this project. When the device is complete
amputee trials will begin to test how much neuroprosthesis performance is improved through consistent feedback
from the user.
